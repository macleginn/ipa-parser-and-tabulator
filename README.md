ipa-parser-and-tabulator
========================

A Python 3 library for parsing and tabulating lists of IPA-encoded phonemes.
It powers eurasianphonology.info/listview/genetic.html. I will add
decent documentation sooner or later, but the library is production ready â€” it was
tested on several hundred inventories. Drop me a line if you want to use it
and have any questions.
